# Reinforcement Learning - CM30359

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to the exploration of various reinforcement learning algorithms, specifically applied to the Ant-v4 MuJoCo environment through OpenAI Gym. The focus is on understanding and implementing different strategies to analyze their effectiveness in a simulated environment.

## Repository Contents

- `DDPG Algorithm`: Implementation of the Deep Deterministic Policy Gradient (DDPG) algorithm.

- `Reinforce Algorithm`: Contains the implementation of the Reinforce algorithm.

- `Reinforce A2C Algorithm`: This section implements the Reinforce Algorithm with the Advantage Actor-Critic (A2C) approach.
